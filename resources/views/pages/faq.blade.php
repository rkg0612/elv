        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            Here are the questions we're asked the most.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">Can I use ELV to influence my online image and corporate brand?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            Yes, of course. The articles we publish, market, and use to grow your company’s online presence are an extension of your brand. With SEO strategy and the authority of our publication partners, we work to ensure that articles written for your brand rank high for relevant search terms in your area and industry.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">Can I choose to write my own articles for you to publish?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            No, we curate all of the content for our clients. Each publication we work with maintains strict editorial guidelines which our writing team is trained to follow. Additionally, our relationships and content experts expedite editorial approval with our partners.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">What are the marketing benefits of working with ELV Agency?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            With the domain authority of our publication partners, many of the articles we publish for your brand will become the top-ranking content for relevant search terms in your industry, establishing your company as a leader in your location and field. Each of our clients is given an author profile at our partners’ sites to showcase your articles and business information, and we sponsor relevant audiences to view your articles and become future customers.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">How does the onboarding process work?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            To begin work, our strategists and content experts will consult with you to establish and identify your persona, values, style and corporate message. Afterward, we’ll fast-track your acceptance to three of our publication partners. We’ll work with their editorial teams and produce content that captures your brand and is tailored for their audiences.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">Do I need to write content or hire an editorial team?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            No, we write and curate all of your articles to ensure that the content we develop for your brand meets our partners’ editorial standards. We have a team dedicated to writing, editing, and proofreading your content, and we work hands-on with our publication partners’ own editors.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">How do I control the quality of the content you write for my brand?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            Our onboarding process involves a thorough consultation with you to make sure our writers capture the philosophy, tone and message you want to convey to your audience or potential customers. Everything we write and market for your business goes through you or your internal team for quality assurance, and articles are only published with your stamp of approval.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted mt-4 mb-0">What media platforms will I have authorship with?</p>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            We work with six of the top media and business publications online. We work with you to approve your brand for three of our six publication partners, matching your company to the editorial brands best suited for your message and audience.
