                Recently, it seems that content marketing and thought leadership have been competing for airspace in the marketing industry. These concepts may seem similar at face value but differ in their fundamental approach to content.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Instead of fueling this competition, we want to show you how to use content marketing to your advantage in your thought leadership content strategy.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                But first, let's look at what makes content marketing and thought leadership so different.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mt-4">Content Marketing vs. Thought Leadership</h4>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Content marketing has been around since the boom of the information age, which took place in the early 2000s. Although it's been around for so long, it's only recently become more mainstream.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Thought leadership's purpose is similar, but it goes beyond sales. Instead, this type of content focuses on sharing relevant content, knowledge, industry insights, and expertise with others. Sure, thought leadership can also promote a brand's product or services, but its purpose differs from content creation.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mt-4">The main differences can be seen in the following aspects:</h4>
            <div class="p-2">
                <h6>1. Purpose</h6>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    Content marketing communicates with potential and existing customers about new products or the brand's strategy.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    Thought leadership marketing strives to equip the target audience with relevant information that can help them solve problems in their business or the industry, all while backed by the brand's ideals and goals.
                </p>
                <h6>2. Audience</h6>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    Content marketing targets a specific audience with an established goal, such as promotional education or brand awareness.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    A thought leader is a respected industry expert whose opinion is valued. Thus, the content driven by a thought leader can often attract a large following.
                </p>
                <h6>3. Format</h6>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    Given its target of reaching people quickly and effectively, marketing content tends to be short and concise. The format ranges from blog posts to listicles to promotional videos.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    Thought leadership content, on the other hand, is usually more extensive and longer, given that its objective is to inform, educate, and inspire. Examples include data storytelling, case studies, industry opinion, analysis, and interviews with top thought leaders.
                </p>
                <h6>4. Distribution</h6>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    Content marketing is mostly about distribution, with special SEO and social media tools employed to ensure the maximum number of readers are reached.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-normal">
                    For thought leadership, however, the target is specific to a certain audience and is distributed directly to that audience through newsletters, educational content, and high-profile websites.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4 class="mt-4">Understand the differences for more success</h4>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Where the Two Concepts Intersect: Best Practices</h4>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Both content marketing and thought leadership have one main goal in common: effective content distribution.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Unique content marketing may enable you to stand out from the competition. Well, so can thought leadership. And one aspect can drive traffic to the other.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                For example, perhaps there's a common problem facing your particular industry. You could have an industry expert or even yourself as the business leader write a blog about it, with advice on how to solve the problem.

            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Once brand helpfulness has been established, the target audience will then look to your products or services to solve their issues because you have already established a relationship of trust.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                And the easiest way for them to find said products or services is through your content marketing efforts.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h4>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                As highlighted above, you can create an effective thought leadership strategy by applying the best content marketing practices to your advantage.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
                Remember to set your goals clearly and specifically before brainstorming, executing, and distributing content. After that, see what your competitors are doing and measure the results.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal">
